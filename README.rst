Synopsis
========

This is a repo of various topics in computer science implemented in python.

Motivation
-----------

I was asked by a several recruiters to provide some example python code.

While I may add more complicated examples to this repo,
    it is primarily intended to demonstrate a basic understanding of programing concepts.

Installation
------------

As this repo is all example code I would highly recommend that you simply cd to the repo directory and import the files as modules. 

   >>> from python_examples import data_structures
   >>> from python_examples import recursion 

Tests
-----

Some of the submodules in this repo have unit tests, you can invoke them by running ***make test*** from the root directory
